Introduction
============

QGraph is the User Engagement Platform for your mobile app.

If you are an app developer you know that keeping your users engaged
with your app is very important. The most important aspect of user
engagement today is via push notifications.

Using QGraph you can send relevant, timely and personalized push 
notifications to your users.

Why QGraph?
-----------
QGraph is the easiest way to send notifications to your app users.
When you use QGraph, you do not need to worry about intricacies
and mechanism of sending notifications, which vary widely across
different platforms. These intricacies are all abstracted out in 
our SDK.

We have made the process of sending notifications as simple
as writing a "Hello World!" program. From registering on our
site to sending a test notification should take less than
15 minutes.

We provide the capabilities for fine grained segmentation
and message customization at per user level. We provide detailed 
statistics about the response to the notifications.

How do I get started?
---------------------
Head over to
http://qgraph.io/
and make an account for yourself. 

Follow the setup steps given there and send a test notification to one or 
more devices.

Once you are done, go to the section "Using QGraph SDK" to do a
complete integration with your app.

You can use our web app at
