Using Web UI
============

Our web UI is present at http://app.qgraph.io/

Using our web UI, you can

#. Follow on boarding steps to send a test notification to your device.
#. Create segments and campaigns to send notifications to your app users.
#. See analytics related to the notifications that you sent.


In the UI, you see four sections 
   (1) Last Modified Users
   (2) Latest Activities
   (3) Campaigns
   (4) Segments

1. Recent Users
----------------------
This section shows profile of last few users which have been active on the app. Once you do some activity on the app, you should be able to see a user corresponding to you in the app. (You can recognize yourself using some of the fields that you have been logging, like email or username)

Here are the fields that you should know about:

   a. *GCM ID:* This is an identifier generated by google which uniquely identifies an app on a device. It needs to be present for QGraph to be able to send a notification to a user.
   
   b. *user Id:* This is your identification of the user. It would usually be an email or user id of the user.

   c. *Other fields:* This shows other user profile fields that may have set using functions like ``setName()``, ``setCity()`` etc, or ``setCustomUserParameter()``.

2. Recent Activities
--------------------
Here you can see the information regarding last few events which have happened on the app.

You should perform some activity in the app which logs a new event, and check that you can see the event.

3. Segments
-----------
A segment is a set of users. In this tab, you specify the criteria for a segment. Users which satisfy all the criteria specified will constitute the segment.

   If you do not specify any criteria, segment will contain all the app users.

4. Campaigns
------------
Once you have created one or more segments, you are ready to create a campaign. You choose a creative type. Choose one of "Base", "Icon", "Big Image" or "Rolling". You fill in all the fields.

As a first step, just choose the "Icon" or "Big Image" type and specify various fields. In this step, fill the same strings in "custom" and "default" fields. Select one of the segments, and click "Add Campaign". Don’t worry, no notifications will go out yet.
   
You can click "Run" to send the notifications to the users. Refresh the screen after some time and you should see some stats about how many notifications were sent. If you are a part of the segment, you should receive a notification too.

As a second step, you can customize the message in two ways:

(1) Suppose you have passed us variables in the user profiles called "name" and "city". Then, if while creating a campaign, in the "custom" title or message you write:

	Hello {{name}}, you live in {{city}}.


Then, for each user, {{name}} and {{city}} will be substituted by the actual variable values. For those users in the segment for whom one of these variables is not present, the “default” string provided by you will be used.

(2) Suppose you provided us an event called `product_viewed` and in the parameters you specified::

      {
         ‘name’: ‘abccamera’,
         ‘pid’: 123,
         ‘price’: 15999,
         ‘image_url’: ‘http://mysite.com/abc-camera.jpg’
         ‘redirect_url’: ‘myapp://myapp.com/123’
      }

Then you can refer to "name", "price", "image_url", "redirect_url" as 
{{product_viewed.0.name}},
{{product_viewed.0.price}},
{{product_viewed.0.image_url}},
{{product_viewed.0.redirect_url}}
respectively.

You can use the first two variables to customize the message, like this:

Hello {{name}}, the prices of {{product_viewed.0.name}} have fallen by 40%!

And you can specify the last two variables to specify the image and redirect url for the notification.
