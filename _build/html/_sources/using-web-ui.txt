Using Web UI
============
You have integrated the SDK. You have also started logging some events and user profile parameters. Now you are ready to send some notifications to the users!

Go to http://mobile.quantumgraph.com

Use your username and password to login.

You see four sections 
   (1) Last Modified Users
   (2) Latest Activities
   (3) Campaigns
   (4) Segments

1. Last Modified Users
----------------------
First you should go to the section titled “Last Modified Users”. This section shows details of last few users which have been active on the app. Once you do some activity on the app, you should be able to see a user corresponding to you in the app. (You can recognize yourself using some of the fields that you have been logging, like email or username)

Here are some important fields that you should know about:

   a. *QG User ID:* It is QuantumGraph's identification of the user. It gets reset when a user reinstalls the app or when a user clears the cache. Usually you would not need to worry about it.
   
   b. *GCM ID:* This is an identifier generated by google which uniquely identifies an app on a device. It needs to be present for QuantumGraph to be able to send a notification to a user.
   
   c. *USERID_ALIAS:* This is your identification of the user. It would usually be an email or user id of the user.

2. Latest Activities
--------------------
Then you should first is to go to “Latest Activities”. Here you can see the information regarding last few events which have happened on the app.

You should perform some activity in the app which logs a new event, and check that you can see the event.

Once you are able to your profile and activities in “Last Modified Users” and “Latest Activities” tabs, you know that QG servers are receiving the data properly.

3. Segments
-----------
A segment is a set of users. In this tab, you specify the criteria for a segment. Users which satisfy all the criteria specified will constitute the segment.
   If you do not specify any criteria, segment will contain all the app users.
   We have already created a segment for you called “AllUsers”. This segment has no conditions and thus all the users belong to it.

4. Campaigns
------------
Once you have created one or more segments, you are ready to create a campaign. You choose a creative type. Choose one of “Base”, “Icon”, “Big Image”or “Rolling”. You fill in all the fields.
   As a first step, just choose the “Icon” or “Big Image” type and specify various fields. In this step, fill the same strings in “custom” and “default” fields. Select one of the segments, and click “Add Campaign”. Don’t worry, no notifications will go out yet.
   
   You can click “Run” to send the notifications to the users. Refresh the screen after some time and you should see some stats about how many notifications were sent. If you are a part of the segment, you should receive a notification too.

   As a second step, you can customize the message in two ways:

(1) Suppose you have passed us variables in the user data (sometimes called ‘master data’) called ‘name’ and ‘city’. Then, if while creating a campaign, in the “custom” title or message you write:
	Hello $name, you live in $city
           Then, for each user, $name and $city will be substituted by the actual variable values. For those users in the segment for whom one of these variables is not present, the “default” string provided by you will be used.

(2) Suppose you provided us an event called “VIEWED_PRODUCT” and in the parameters you specified::

      {
         ‘name’: ‘abccamera’,
         ‘pid’: 123,
         ‘price’: 15999,
         ‘image_url’: ‘http://mysite.com/abc-camera.jpg’
         ‘redirect_url’: ‘myapp://myapp.com/123’
      }

(the names of the keys: ‘name’, ‘price’ etc are your choice).

Then you can refer to ‘name’, ‘price’, ‘image_url’, ‘redirect_url’ as 
$E.VIEWED_PRODUCT.0.name
$E.VIEWED_PRODUCT.0.price
$E.VIEWED_PRODUCT.0.image_url
$E.VIEWED_PRODUCT.0.redirect_url
respectively.

You can use the first two variables to customize the message, like this:

Hello $name, the prices of $E.VIEWED_PRODUCT.0.name have fallen by 40%!
And you can specify the last two variables to specify the image and redirect url for the notification.
